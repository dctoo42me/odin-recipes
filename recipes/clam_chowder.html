        <p>Creamy soup of clams served with hot sourdough bread, or better yet, in a 
            sourdough bread bowl.
        </p>
        <h3 class="title">Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 pound bacon, cut into 1/2 in pieces</li>
            <li>5 unpeeled potatoes, diced</li>
            <li>2 carrots, diced</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2(6.5 ounce) cans chopped clams with juice</li>
            <li>2(1.8 ounce) packages dry leek soup mix</li>
            <li>1 quart half and half</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="title">Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the bacon in a large pot and cook over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until crisped and browned, about 10 minutes. Remove the bacon with a slotted spoon, leaving the drippings in the pot. Set the bacon aside. Stir the potatoes and carrots into the bacon fat. Season with salt and pepper, and cook for 5 minutes, stirring frequently.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Pour the juice from the clams into the pot, and add enough water to just cover the potatoes. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the potatoes are just tender, 10 to 15 minutes.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>Gently stir the leek soup mix into the potatoes until no lumps of soup remain. Stir in the clams, reserved bacon, and half-and-half cream. Cook and stir until the chowder returns to a simmer and thickens, about 10 minutes more.
            </li>
        </ol>
